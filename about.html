            <p id="text">We are a program that matches journalists with high school students to help them improve their <br>functional writing skills and open them up to the opportunities afforded within the field <br>of journalism.
Journalists and students alike are invited to apply to the program <br>through our website. The application form is brief and serves as a way for us to <br>learn about our customers and their fields of interest.
Accepted students will be <br>matched with a professional in a semester long mentorship program that focuses <br>on guiding the participants through writing assignments, <br>discussion, and feedback from peers and professionals. Students will have the chance to <br>publish their writing on our website. </p>
